/*
Primitive and non-primitive only two types of datatypes are present in js
non-primitive is also called reference data type
in js datatypes are categorised into two based on how they are stored inside memory
and how to access them
Primitive data types are stored inside stack while reference are sotred inside heap while
there reference or address or pointer is stored inside stack
Javascript is dynamically typed language because the type of variables is determined by the 
interpreter/compiler at the runtime based on variables value at that time 
change is done on the copy of a value in stack
change is done on the original value in heap*/
